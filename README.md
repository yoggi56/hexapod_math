# hexapod_math
Simulink models for the hexapod robot. 
There are two files:
    - fkine.slx - solving the forward kinematic problem for all hexapod legs
    - ikine.slx - solving the inverse kinematic problem for all hexapod legs
    
Also it is neccessary to copy the file 'runfirst.m' to the same folder because it contains initial parameters for models. You don't need to run it before running the model, everything goes automatically.
